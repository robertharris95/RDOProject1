# RDOProject1 Loqal Music Discovery Application
Our First Major Project
An application created with the purpose of helping users discover new music, based on genre through random selection, as well as listen to todays top hits.  

# User Story 
As an individual living in the age of Aquarius, it is often times hard to find new music due to overly played tracks, and the influx of artists.  I WANT to discover new music in a particular genre WITHOUT having to search for a particular artist SO THAT the process is more convenient and requires less thought process to enjoy music.  I WOULD also like the ability to uncover popular tracks in todays age.
